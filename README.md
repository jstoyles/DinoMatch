My first mobile app game built with Flutter/Dart

I still consider myself somewhat of a beginner when it comes to Flutter, but I also think I've come a long way in a short period of time.
This app is the first "game" I built using Flutter. It's a simple memory match game and thought I'd share it here for anyone who wants to start learning Flutter.

I welcome any feedback, especially from more experienced Flutter/Dart developers!
